# Social Media Revenue Share Platform

## Project Description

The Social Media Revenue Share Platform is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that revolutionizes how content creators monetize their work. Unlike traditional social media platforms where creators rely on ad revenue sharing or sponsorships, this platform enables direct peer-to-peer tipping from users to creators based on content engagement.

Creators can post content (stored on IPFS for decentralization) and immediately start earning cryptocurrency tips from users who appreciate their work. The smart contract handles all transactions transparently, ensuring creators receive their earnings instantly while maintaining a small platform fee for sustainability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fair, transparent, and decentralized social media ecosystem where:

- **Creators are directly compensated** for quality content without intermediaries
- **Users have direct influence** on creator success through tipping
- **Transparency is maintained** through blockchain technology
- **Censorship resistance** is achieved through decentralized infrastructure
- **Global accessibility** enables creators worldwide to monetize content regardless of location or banking access

We aim to shift the power from centralized platforms back to creators and their communities, fostering genuine content creation over algorithm-gaming strategies.
